			<h2>part the first: why?</h2>
			<p><i>no like seriously why, why do this to yourself, you buffoon, you child, you absolute imbecile. there are so many citation systems out there, why do you need to put in the effort to make your own????</i></p>
			<p>... look. Don't come at me like this. I'm a perfectionist and a dumbass with a need to do everything myself so I can perfectly customize it, ok???</p>
			<p>That, and, I do have some... kinda legitimate reasons for wanting to design my own citation system for this website.</p>
			<p>For starters, I have a uniquely structured source in the MTD that existing citation systems will be clunky to adapt to using, and since half the reason I made the MTD was to cite it, I need a good citation system to use with it.</p>
			<p>I'm also trying to describe sources in two languages in a way that enables other people to find the exact thing I'm talking about and look into it more.</p>

			<h2>part the second: parameters and considerations</h2>
			<p>So what kinds of things will I need to take under consideration when designing this custom citation system?</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Usecases</li>
				<ul>
					<li>Footnotes on the MTD</li>
					<li>Discord messages - aka, there needs to be a short and really fast to type quick-cite method</li>
					<li>Articles on this website</li>
				</ul>
				<li>Common source types</li>
				<ul>
					<li>MTD</li>
					<li>Ancient Chinese poetry anthologies</li>
					<li>Ancient Chinese classics</li>
					<li>Modern English translations of the above, sometimes multiple translations for the same Chinese source</li>
					<li>Websites in Chinese that I may be using machine translation to understand, with the accompanying possibility of error</li>
				</ul>
			</ul>
			<h2>part the third: a review of existing citation systems</h2>
			<p>I'm a dumbass, but I'm not <i>stupid</i>. People have already done the work of developing citation systems already. I'm not gonna use them wholesale, but I can and will cannibalize them for parts.</p>
			<h3>Styles I'm familiar with</h3>
			<h4>Modern Language Association</h4>
			<p><a href="https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/mla_style/mla_formatting_and_style_guide/mla_formatting_and_style_guide.html">Purdue Online Writing Lab MLA Formatting and Style Guide</a></p>
			<p>MLA sucks. It relies too much on hyperspecific punctuation and ordering and is uninuitive to both read and write. The lessons to be learned here are in what NOT to do. </p>
			<p>The 8th edition of MLA abstracts and generalizes where sources are into "containers", which may be layered. This is... initially appealing, but on further consideration I think it's uninuitive, just like the reliance on ordering and punctuation. What counts as a container? What's required in order to locate the source again?</p>
			<p>For my own uses, it might be useful to frame what's important to include in a citation in terms of "How would I tell someone where to find the thing I read from?" One of my usecases, as mentioned earlier, is sharing the things I find with other people. But links break, so the information needs to be written out and not just kept within a link. So, with that in mind, including the aggregator "containor", e.g. Netflix or JSTOR, is important.</p>
			<p>Also. Do NOT use forward slashes or back slashes in citations, what the fuck!</p>
			<p>Including date of access for online sources... I am not convinced that it is as important as the Modern Language Association makes it out to be. Ditigital sources are not <i>that</i> variable, come on, and besides, it won't be helpful in tracking down the exact source because digital archives do not keep copies of a site <i>for every day</i>. The Wayback Machine, the largest digital archive organization, varies in its archive frequency from months to upwards of years. For sites that are in active maintenance and are freuqnetly updated, especially ones with multiple users - such as a social media or wiki article - a specific date of access may be useful. However, for the majority of sites, the date of publication/last updated is sufficient, or the date of your work.</p>
			<p>tl;dr: Consider carefully whether access date is useful to the citation, and only include it if it is likely to be important.</p>
			<p>Moving on.</p>
			<h4>The Chicago Manual of Style</h4>
			<p><a href="https://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/tools_citationguide.html">Chicago Style Citation Quick Guide</a></p>
			<p>The Chicago style is the one I am most familiar with, as it is the standard for history and social sciences.</p>
			<p>I don't think there's anything particularly transcendental about the Chicago style, which is part of its appeal. It's ordinary and plain, and that makes it fairly intuitive to use once you learn the patterns of it. It's just a repeating pattern of Autor, Title, In, until you get to the publisher. </p>
			<p>There are two forms of the Chicago style: the Notes and Bibliography style (N&B) and the Author-Date style (A-D). N&B uses in-text superscript, short citation footnotes, and a bibliography. A-D uses in-text parentheticals.</p>
			<p>N&B style is more flexible with its sources than A-D. A-D, notably, cannot accomodate sources with no author. Sources with no author are simply left out of the reference list, even when they are important. The best that can be done in A-D style in that case is to describe the source in-text, which is inefficient in space and readers' time.</p>
			<p>The bibliography entries of N&B style and the reference entries of A-D style are formatted very similarly. Broadly, they go:
				<blockquote>Authorial information. Source title. Source container information. Editorial information. Publication information. Format information.</blockquote>
			Exceptions are made for websites, where date information is included immediately after the author name. The same exception is <em>not</em> made for social media posts, which are formatted like articles if they are included in the bibliography at all. The reason for this exception is unclear, so I will absolutely not be adapting it. 
			</p>
			<!-- <p>For books:
				<blockquote>Author, and Other Authors. <i>Title</i>. Translated/Edited/Commentated by Translator/Editor/Commentator. Location: Publisher, Date. Format/Database/URL.</blockquote>
			</p>
			<p>For chapters:
				<blockquote>Author. "Title." In <i>Book Title</i>, edited by Editor, chapter page numbers. Location: Publisher, Date.</blockquote>
			</p>
			<p>For journal articles:
				<blockquote>Author, Other Authors, In Alphabetical Order, and Up To Ten. "Article Title, in full: Including all Punctuation etc." <i>Journal Title</i> Vol#, no. # (Date): Page Numbers. DOI/Database/URL.</blockquote>
			News articles are formatted likewise, save that the date of the article's publication replaces the volume number.
			</p> -->

			<h4>The American Anthropological Association</h4>
			<p><a href="https://americananthro.org/publications/publishing-style-guide/">AAA Style Guide</a></p>
			<p>AAA style is an offshoot of Chicago style. It's broadly similar to the in-text Author-Date style. Page ranges are only used for quotations or very specific information. The reference list is the same as in the Chicago style. In-text citations use the Wiley style. Of note there is the use of semi-colons to seperate multiple citations supporting the same piece of information.</p>
			<p></p>
			<h3>Styles developed for a digital context</h3>
			<h4>Wikipedia</h4>
			<p>In particular, I want to look at the formatting rules for a digital context. MLA and Chicago are both intended for print or journal contexts, and so have rules about things like print margins and page numbers, both of which are not relevant to a digital format.</p>
			<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Introduction_to_the_Manual_of_Style/1">Introduction to Wikipedia Manual of Style</a>
				<br><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style">Wikipedia Manual of Style</a>
				<br><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Referencing_for_beginners">Help:Referencing For Beginners</a>
				<br><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources">Wikipedia:Citing Sources</a>
				<br><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources/Further_considerations">Wikipedia:Citing Sources - Further Considerations</a>
			</p>
			<p>Wikipedia's basic guidelines on citations are that they should be consistent &mdash; the same as the style already used in the article, even if that is different from the default style &mdash; and should provide enough information for a reader to identify the source. The formatting can be improved later, but if a source can't be identified, it's a bad citation.</p>
			<p>Wikipedia's manual of style also has clear and simple instructions on <em>when</em> to cite sources.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>All quotations</li>
				<li>Any challenged or likely to be challenged information</li>
				<li>Contentious or controversial material about living persons</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Wikipedia uses a system of superscript numbers for inline citations, which correspond to a reference list at the end of the article. Unique to the digital structure, Wikipedia's in-line citations hyperlink to the corresponding reference and vice versa, along with having a tooltip appear with the reference information when the hyperlink is hovered over. This allows users to easily view the full source information without losing their place in the text, and with a very efficient use of space in the content and on the page. Citations citing specific sections of a source use the full source with the section included if it is the first time this source is cited, and after use a shortened citation beginning with "Op. Cit." to indicate that the reference has already been used. (Other citation styles are allowed by Wikipedia, including one that has seperate Note and Reference sections, however, I think this is inefficient and visually repetative, as both are placed at the bottom of the article, one right after the other.)</p>
			<p>Wikipedia's MOS does allow for general references &mdash; references not attached to any specific inline citation. General references are listed after references with inline citations in the reference list. </p>
			<p>Wikipedia does make use of access dates, listed as "Retrieved" at the end of the reference. For Wikipedia's level of specificity, its frequent editing, and its frequent interaction with highly mutable sites, this is reasonable.</p>
			<p>In its "Further Considerations" article, Wikipedia's MOS advises cleaning up URLs before using them in citations. I.e. removing session IDs, tracking parameters, trailing slashes on root urls, using desktop links, etc., generally ensuring the URL is as standard as it can be made. It also advises using a pre-emptive archive URL where possible. For me, this would change to "where reasonable", but when citing highly mutable sites, I think this is very reasonable.</p>
			<p>Wikipedia's linked citations work differently on the .m site vs the desktop site. In the mobile site, a javascript script triggers a "drawer" div to be added to the page, and then deleted when you click out of the drawer. This allows the citation to pop up in a readable format for the mobile user, without mistaking a "tap to bring up the citation tooltip" for a "click to go to the reference section". However, it doesn't allow jumping to the reference section. Is this a loss, on mobile?</p>

				Endymion Wilkinson, Chinese History: A Manual, 4th ed. (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Asia Center, 2015); see especially pp. xvii–xxiii.
			</p>
			<p>"The guiding principle for HJAS citation style is that nonspecialist readers (such as beginning graduate students) interested in following up on any specific citation must be able to find the quoted or referenced passage in the work and must have sufficient information to locate and access the source material (either through interlibrary loan or an in-person visit)"</p>
			<p>Pre-modern and indigenous measurements should have metric conversions in parentheses. The American units can be added as a bonus.</p>
			<p>Where names or terms change over time, use the preferred name (as far as it can be determined) or the most commonly used term in the text, and provide the term as used in the source in the notes. Alternate names are typically provided in square brackets. This is done so other works by the same author may be more easily found.</p>
			<p>Romanizations should be italicized for every instance if the term is not anglicized. Names are not italicized. When an author of Asian heritage also publishes in English, their preferred Romanization should be respected. The order of names should match the language they published in. Lastname, Firstname structure is not used in references. Preferred Romanization styles are provided for Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Manchu, Mongolian, Tibetan, Russian, Sanskrit, Arabic, and Turkic. Translations of Asian-language sources are not provided in the notes.</p>
			<p>This journal prefers "PMingLiU" as its font, which I'm pretty sure is just Microsoft's name for its Songtai font for traditional characters.</p>
			<p>Both the volume (ce 册) number of the specific edition of a historical source should be included, as well as the traditional juan 卷 number. Same for page numbers &mdash; both the modern and traditional should be included. The full edition citation information should be provided for even the most well-known historical sources. There is also a note about digital sources and ctext.org in particular, about citing authoritative sources and that digital sources may not be authoritative. This is something to be considered, as an amateur researcher I don't have the time or resources to track down authoritative sources or ensure concordance.</p>
			<p>There is a vast deal more material on style in the Endymion Wilkinson textbook. I have skimmed it, but not reviewed it in depth. I will likely return and consult it in the future, but I don't think it will be necessary for a citation system.</p>

			<p><a href="https://dukeupress.edu/Assets/Downloads/JAS_style_guide.pdf">JAS Style Sheet</a></p>
			<p><i>Transcription</i> &lt;Original Characters&gt; [English translation.] is used for presenting Asian scripts in references. In the text, the translated or original may be presented first, and the other presented in parentheses afterwards. The translated title uses the form it would take if it were a published translation, even if there is no published translation.</p>
			<p>Latin abbreviations should be spelled out in the text or avoided. Abbreviations are permitted in notes. Grammar and capitalization in quotes should be ammended to match the context of where it is used.</p>
			<h4>China Quarterly</h4>

				<blockquote>
					<strong>Romanization.</strong> Use <i>pinyin</i> without tone/diacritical marks, except: Chiang Kai-shek, Sun Yat-sen, Taipei, Kuomintang, Peking University, Tsinghua University, names of people living outside mainland China.
					<br>
					<br>
					<strong>Chinese characters.</strong> Chinese characters are incorporated into article texts (i.e. English (pinyin, characters)) so authors must provide Chinese characters for all Chinese phrases and proper nouns used in the main text (not footnotes) on first appearance. Characters for people’s names and geographical locations should follow the pinyin transcription without brackets. However, Chinese characters are not needed for names of provinces, municipalities and provincial capitals.
				</blockquote>
			</p>
			<p>Pinyin words are not capitalized unless they are proper nouns. Characters of original titles for sources are not necessarily used in sources (an oversight, imo). </p>
			<h4>Modern Chinese Literature and Culture </h4>
			<p><a href="https://www.euppublishing.com/pb-assets/Journals%20website/Author%20Guidelines/MCLC_style_for_authors-1621586373.pdf">MCLC Style Guide</a></p>
			<p>Pinyin or other Romanization terms are italicized, but proper names are not. For repeated use, subsequent italization is optional. English translation is placed first in the text, with pinyin following after in parenthesis. This may be reversed in some cases. Subsequent mentions should use English unless there is good reason not to. Chinese characters are only used "for poetry or to highlight points about language." I disagree with this use, as it conceals the specific nuance and connotation that may be assigned to the original term, and not including the characters makes it harder for people to find more information about the subject, especially when dealing with niche topics that may not have extensive English resources about them or be commonly searched for.</p> 
			<p>In references, the <i>Pinyin</i> &lt;Characters&gt; (Translation) structure is used. Character are not provided for publishers or journals &mdash; the name is presented as it commonly is in English, or in Pinyin with "chubanshe" or "press" or similar category names omitted. An older style of Chicago style is used where dates are placed immediately after the name of the author.</p>
			<p>A glossary of Chinese terms should be included at the end of the article. Names of dynasties, provinces, large municipalities, and authors included in the reference list, should not be included.</p>
			<h4>Hong Kong University Journal of Chinese Studies</h4>
			<p><a href="https://www.hkujcs.hku.hk/style-sheet-english">English Style Sheet</a></p>
			<p>This journal, like most of the others, bases their style off of the Chicago style</p>
			<p>The Pinyin Romanization system specifically is used, and all terms are presented in the <i>Pinyin</i> &lt;Characters&gt; (Translation) structure. In references, the parentheses are exchanged for brackets.</p>
			<p>The first time a historical figure is mentioned, provide their birth and death dates, and their Chinese name if there is one. Include a BCE/CE date in parentheses after a date in Chinese dynastic chronology.</p>
			<p>Simplified characters should be changed to traditional characters.</p>
			<p>This has the most extensive examples of Chinese sources cited, and may be the most useful in that regards.</p>
			<h3>Conclusions from the Review</h3>
			<p>yeah that was good, i learned stuff.</p> 
			<p>Some were more useful than others, but nearly every citation system had something worthwhile to learn from, something it had thought of that I ought to consider. Even stupid decisions were useful to know about and consider as potential pitfalls. It was particularly useful to see how different systems adapted to their specific contexts and needs. </p>
			

			authoritative sources
			<h2>part the fourth: towards a manual of style</h2>
			<p>And now we bring together my goals with my observations and my thoughts, to create my own system. Beginning with the broadest strokes:</p>
			<p>When I cite something, I am doing three things. First, I am telling my readers how to find the source I used to get my information, in case they want to fact check me or do their own further research. Second, I am giving the reader the context of how I got my information, so they can understand the limitations of my conclusions. Third, I am respecting the scholars and amateurs who came before me and the work they put in. These three things should be kept in mind when I cite something, and I should strive to fulfill all three with my citations.</p>
			<p>Other princples. Who is the reader? Non-specialist. That means not a specialist researcher - provide access where possible. People who aren't native english speakers or accustomed to academia - No latin Plainess. Consistency.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Notes & Bibliography - why?</p>
			<p>Integrating notes with the coding of my website, accessibility?</p>
			<p>Bibliographic entry structure. Route/containers. Date of access.</p>

				<li>There should be a difference in the way that star sources and side sources are cited.</li>
