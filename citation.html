			<h2>part the first: why?</h2>
			<p><i>no like seriously why, why do this to yourself, you buffoon, you child, you absolute imbecile. there are so many citation systems out there, why do you need to put in the effort to make your own????</i></p>
			<p>... look. Don't come at me like this. I'm a perfectionist and a dumbass with a need to do everything myself so I can perfectly customize it, ok???</p>
			<p>That, and, I do have some... kinda legitimate reasons for wanting to design my own citation system for this website.</p>
			<p>For starters, I have a uniquely structured source in the MTD that existing citation systems will be clunky to adapt to using, and since half the reason I made the MTD was to cite it, I need a good citation system to use with it.</p>
			<p>I'm also trying to describe sources in two languages in a way that enables other people to find the exact thing I'm talking about and look into it more.</p>

			<h2>part the second: parameters and considerations</h2>
			<p>So what kinds of things will I need to take under consideration when designing this custom citation system?</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Usecases</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Footnotes on the MTD</li>
						<li>Discord messages - aka, there needs to be a short and really fast to type quick-cite method</li>
						<li>Articles on this website</li>
					</ul>
				<li>Common source types</li>
					<ul>
						<li>MTD</li>
						<li>Ancient Chinese poetry anthologies</li>
						<li>Ancient Chinese classics</li>
						<li>Modern English translations of the above, sometimes multiple translations for the same Chinese source</li>
						<li>Websites in Chinese that I may be using machine translation to understand, with the accompanying possibility of error</li>
					</ul>
			</ul>
			<h2>part the third: a review of existing citation systems</h2>
			<p>I'm a dumbass, but I'm not <i>stupid</i>. People have already done the work of developing citation systems already. I'm not gonna use them wholesale, but I can and will cannibalize them for parts.</p>
			<h3>Styles I'm familiar with</h3>
			<h4>Modern Language Association</h4>
			<p><a href="https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/mla_style/mla_formatting_and_style_guide/mla_formatting_and_style_guide.html">Purdue Online Writing Lab MLA Formatting and Style Guide</a></p>
			<p>MLA sucks. It relies too much on hyperspecific punctuation and ordering and is uninuitive to both read and write. The lessons to be learned here are in what NOT to do. </p>
			<p>The 8th edition of MLA abstracts and generalizes where sources are into "containers", which may be layered. This is... initially appealing, but on further consideration I think it's uninuitive, just like the reliance on ordering and punctuation. What counts as a container? What's required in order to locate the source again?</p>
			<p>For my own uses, it might be useful to frame what's important to include in a citation in terms of "How would I tell someone where to find the thing I read from?" One of my usecases, as mentioned earlier, is sharing the things I find with other people. But links break, so the information needs to be written out and not just kept within a link. So, with that in mind, including the aggregator "containor", e.g. Netflix or JSTOR, is important.</p>
			<p>Also. Do NOT use forward slashes or back slashes in citations, what the fuck!</p>
			<p>Including date of access for online sources... I am not convinced that it is as important as the Modern Language Association makes it out to be. Ditigital sources are not <i>that</i> variable, come on, and besides, it won't be helpful in tracking down the exact source because digital archives do not keep copies of a site <i>for every day</i>. The Wayback Machine, the largest digital archive organization, varies in its archive frequency from months to upwards of years. For sites that are in active maintenance and are freuqnetly updated, especially ones with multiple users - such as a social media or wiki article - a specific date of access may be useful. However, for the majority of sites, the date of publication/last updated is sufficient, or the date of your work.</p>
			<p>tl;dr: Consider carefully whether access date is useful to the citation, and only include it if it is likely to be important.</p>
			<p>Moving on.</p>
			<h4>The Chicago Manual of Style</h4>
			<p><a href="https://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/tools_citationguide.html">Chicago Style Citation Quick Guide</a></p>
			<p>The Chicago style is the one I am most familiar with, as it is the standard for history and social sciences.</p>
			<p>I don't think there's anything particularly transcendental about the Chicago style, which is part of its appeal. It's ordinary and plain, and that makes it fairly intuitive to use once you learn the patterns of it. It's just a repeating pattern of Autor, Title, In, until you get to the publisher. </p>
			<p>Chicago style does not have reference entries in A-D format for sources with no author. </p>
			<h4>The American Anthropological Association</h4>
			<p><a href="https://americananthro.org/publications/publishing-style-guide/">AAA Style Guide</a></p>
			<p>AAA style is an offshoot of Chicago style. It's broadly similar to the in-text Author-Date style. Page ranges are only used for quotations or very specific information. The reference list is the same as in the Chicago style.</p>
			<p>(Author, Date, page range; other citations)</p>
			<p></p>
			<h3>Styles developed for a digital context</h3>
			<h4>Wikipedia</h4>
			<p>In particular, I want to look at the formatting rules for a digital context. MLA and Chicago are both intended for print or journal contexts, and so have rules about things like print margins and page numbers, both of which are not relevant to a digital format.</p>
			<p></p>
