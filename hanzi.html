			<h1>汉字 - Han Zi - 漢字</h1>
			<h2>三百千 - Three, Hundred, Thousand</h2>
			<p>三百千 (San Bai Qian, Three Hundred Thousand) are three texts used as introductory literacy texts after the Song Dynasty. Together, they contain about 2,000 characters, which is a good foundation for learning the other 13,000+ hanzi.</p>
			<uL>
				<li>三字經 (San Zi Jing, Three Character Classic) is a summary of Confucianism suitable for teaching young children.</li>
				<li>百家姓 (Bai Jia Xing, Hundred Family Surnames) is a list of around 500 surnames circa the Song Dynasty, in no particular order.</li>
				<li>千字文 (Qiān Zì Wén, Thousand Character Classic) is a poem containing exactly one thousand characters, each used only once. Its structure and content make it akin to an "alphabet song".</li>
			</uL>
			<h2>部首 - Radicals</h2>
			<p>Radicals or "section headers" are parts of hanzi used to classify and group hanzi. They may be semantic components, phonetic components, or just an isolated section of a character. Many are derived from the simplest hanzi.</p>
			<p>I decided to try using those radicals which are also hanzi in their own right as a memorization scheme that can hopefully give me a boost in identifying and memorizing more complex hanzi.</p>
